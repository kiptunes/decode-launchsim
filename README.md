# decode-launchsim
A simple projectile motion simulator specifically for FTC DECODE 2024.

requirements
pygame, pygame-textinput\

text input currently DOES NOT WORK and there is no in-program way to change initial velocity so that has to be done IN THE CODE. It is entered initially in CM/S. It is one of the first lines of the code for ease of access. sorry!
